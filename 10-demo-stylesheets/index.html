        <h1 class="font">Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
        <p>A style sheet is simply a text file that contains one or more rules that determine (through properties and
            values) how certain elements in your Web page should be displayed.</p>
    </header>

    <main>
        <section>
            <!-- We added the font class here
                classes are seperated by spaces.
                so on the h2 here we have two classes
                - "font"
                - "success"
            -->
            <h2 class="font success">Creating an Embedded Style Sheet</h2>
            <p>An embedded style sheet is the second way to apply CSS to a page. It lets you set the styles directly in
                the HTML document you want to affect (typically it goes in the head). Because the styles are in that
                HTML file only, the CSS won't apply to other pages like a liked external style sheet does, and you won't
                get the same caching benefits either. As mentioned earlier, an external style sheet is the recommended
                approach for most cases, but it's important to understand your options for the times you'll need to
                deviate.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>To create an embedded style sheet:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Type style in the head section of the HTML document.</li>
                    <li>Define as many style rules as desired.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
        </section>
        <!-- example of an inline style. WE WILL NOT BE USING THIS METHOD!-->
        <section>
            <!-- We added the font class here

            -->
            <h2 class="font danger">Applying Inline Styles</h2>
            <p>Inline styles are the third way to apply CSS to HTML. However, they are by far the least desirable option
                because they intertwine your content (HTML) and presentation (CSS), a slap in the face to best
                practices.</p>
            <p>An inline style affects only one element, so you lose one of the key benefits an external style sheet
                provides: Write once and see everywhere. Imagine having to sift through a slew of HTML pages to make a
                simple font color change, and you can see why inline styles aren't intended for regular use.</p>
            <section>
                <h3>To apply inline styles:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Type style=" "within the HTML open tag of the element
                        that you want to format.</li>
                    <li>Create a style rule without curly brackets or a selector. The selector isn't necessary since
                        you're placing it directly inside the desired element.</li>
                    <li>To create additional style definitions, type ; (a semicolon) and repeat step 2.</li>
                    <li>Type the final quote mark ".</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>Creating an External Style Sheet</h2>
            <p>External style sheets are ideal for giving most or all of the pages on your Web site a consistent look.
                You can define all your styles in an external style sheet and then tell each page on your site to load
                the external sheet, thu ensuring that each will have the same settings. Although you will learn about
                embedded and inline styles, adding CSS to your page from an external style sheet is a best practice, so
                it is recommened that you use this method (allowing for occasional exceptions).</p>

                <h3>How to create and link an external style sheet:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a new file document in your text editor.</li>
                    <li>Save the document in the desired directory with the name "styles" and the extension ".css" to
                        designate it as a Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
                    <li>Create a link to this file in the head of the document (after the title tag) of each HTML page
                        in which you wish to use the style sheet. &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href=" "&gt;</li>
                    <li>Include the relative path to the CSS file in the href attribute."css/styles.css"
                    </li>
