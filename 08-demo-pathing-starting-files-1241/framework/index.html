            <h2>Absolute File Paths</h2>
            <p>
                An absolute URL shows the entire path to the file, including the scheme, the server name, the complete path, and the file name itself. The location of the absolute URL itself has no bearing on the location of the actual file referenced. When you are referencing a file from someone else's server, you'll always use an absolute URL.
