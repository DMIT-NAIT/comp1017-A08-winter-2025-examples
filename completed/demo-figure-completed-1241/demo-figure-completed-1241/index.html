    <title>The Use of the Figure Tag in HTML5</title>

    <!-- The content of this page explains the use of the <figure> tag and <figcaption> tag -->

    <h1>The Figure Element</h1>

    <p>In HTML, the figure tag is used to include self-contained information such as illustrations, diagrams, or code listings in a document. It is linked to the main flow, but it may be used at any place in a document, and the figure flows with the content, thus removing it should not impact the flow of the document. HTML5 includes a new tag for this purpose.</p>

    <p>The figure tag comes with an optional figcaption element and can even contain multiple images with a single caption. The caption belongs to the image and not the main document.</p>

    <h2>The Difference Between Figure and Image Tags</h2>

    <p>The image tag is used to add an image to an HTML page.</p>
    <!-- image tag -->

    <p>A figure is used to semantically organize or group the content of images, diagrams, blocks of code, and/or a caption in the document. It provides a way to wrap this content and group it together.</p>
