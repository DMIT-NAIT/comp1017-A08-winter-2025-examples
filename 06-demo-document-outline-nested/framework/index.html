                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar
                        until light and fluffy.</li>
                    <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                    <li>Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the creamed butter and sugar mixture, stirring well
                        after each addition.</li>
                    <li>Gently fold in the chocolate chips until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
                    <li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Chilling the dough helps
                        the cookies retain their shape while baking and enhances the flavor.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.
                    </li>
                    <li>Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a few
                        minutes to soften slightly.</li>
                    <li>Scoop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches
                        apart.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may still look slightly
                        soft, but they will firm up as the cookies cool.</li>
                    <li>Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer
                        them to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
                    <li>Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week. To maintain
                        their freshness, you can also store them in the refrigerator or freeze them for longer storage.
                    </li>
                    <li>Note: Feel free to customize your cookies by adding chopped nuts, coconut flakes, dried fruits,
                        or even a sprinkle of sea salt on top.</li>
                </ol>
