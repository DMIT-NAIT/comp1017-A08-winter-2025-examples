    <p>
        Once upon a time there were three bears, who lived together in a house of their own, in the woods.
        One of them was a Little Wee Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great Big Bear.

    <h2>The Porridge Incident</h2>

    <p>
        One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-bowls, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon, for they were polite, well-brought-up Bears. And while they were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house, and looked in at the window. And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up little girl. And what did she see?
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Three steaming bowls of porridge</li>
        <li>A wooden spoon</li>
        <li>A charming dining table</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Then seeing that nobody was in the house, she lifted the latch. The door was not fastened, because the bears were good bears, who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and was pleased to see porridge on the table. If she had been a well-brought-up little girl, she would have waited till the bears came home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast; for they were good bears - a little rough or so, but very good-natured and hospitable. However, she was an impudent, rude little girl, and so she set about helping herself.
