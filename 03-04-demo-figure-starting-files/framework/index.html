    <title>The Use of the Figure Tag in HTML5</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>The Figure Element</h1>

    <p>In HTML, the figure tag is used to include self-contained information such as illustrations, diagrams, or code listings in a document. It is linked to the main flow, but it may be used at any place in a document, and the figure flows with the content, thus removing it should not impact the flow of the document. HTML5 includes a new tag for this purpose.</p>

    <p>The figure tag comes with an optional figcaption element and can even contain multiple images with a single caption. The caption belongs to the image and not the main document.</p>

    <h2>The Difference Between Figure and Image Tags</h2>

    <p>The image tag is used to add an image to an HTML page.</p>
    <!-- image tag -->
    <img src="img/jack-russell-terrier.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="A portrait of a Jack Russell Terrier">

    <p>A figure is used to semantically organize or group the content of images, diagrams, blocks of code, and/or a caption in the document. It provides a way to wrap this content and group it together.</p>

    <figure>
        <img
            src="img/dog-chart.jpg"
            width="500"
            height="596"
            alt="a chart of different dog breeds."
        />
        <!-- add a caption -->
        <figcaption>
            A chart of different dog breeds
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
