                <h2>Bike Park 101</h2>
                <p>A mountain bike park is a dedicated area designed specifically for off-road cycling, offering trails
                    and features tailored to riders of all skill levels. These parks typically include a mix of terrain,
                    such as flowy single tracks, technical downhill sections, jumps, berms, and pump tracks. Whether
                    you're a beginner looking to practice on gentle slopes or an expert seeking adrenaline-pumping
                    descents, there's something for everyone.</p>

                <h2>Trails & Maps</h2>
                <p>Navigating a mountain bike park starts with understanding its trail system and layout. Most parks
                    feature a variety of trails, marked by difficulty levels ranging from beginner-friendly green trails
                    to challenging black diamonds for advanced riders. Each trail offers a unique experience, whether
                    it's smooth, winding paths or steep, rocky descents. Knowing the type of trail you want to tackle
                    can help you choose the right route for your skill level and desired riding style.</p>
